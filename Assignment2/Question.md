OBJECTIVE

THE PROBLEM

You have been in a fancy restaurant with four of your best friends. All the individual bills are brought to the table, and it is time to add the tip and to compute everyone’s share. Since nobody ordered anything extravagantly expensive, you decide that everyone will pay an equal share of the bill.

Inside your program, you must declare Ten variables: one for each of the names and one for each of the bills. Assume the group has five people. Request names of the five attendees and store them in variables ‘name1’, …, ‘name5’. Then assign bills for each person and store each of them in the corresponding variables: ‘bill1’, …,’bill5’. Print out both of those sets of variables. Next ask for input for the tip percentage and compute and print the total bill and the amount each person must pay. Values should be printed with only 2 digits after the decimal place.

You are NOT ALLOWED to use for loops or arrays. All variables must be declared and used. You will get a ZERO if you do not comply with the instructions.

Your program should start by comments that includes your name, the program name, the Course number, the semester, and a short description of the program, as in:

/*Tanvir Rahman, Peoplesoft ID: 111111

Program #1: Sharing the bill.

This program computes individual shares of a restaurant bill. */

Output: The following example demonstrates the expected output from running your program.

Note that these names and bills must be entered by the user from the keyboard and not hardcoded in your program.

Enter name of friend: David
Enter name of friend: John

Enter name of friend: Jane

Enter name of friend: Smith

Enter name of friend: Ali

Enter bill for David: 25.2

Enter bill for John: 22.99

Enter bill for Jane: 23.5

Enter bill for Smith: 24.0

Enter bill for Ali: 24.8

Names of Friends: David, John, Jane, Smith, Ali

Individual bills: 25.2, 22.99, 23.5, 24.0, 24.8

Enter tip percentage: 20

Total bill plus tip: $ 144.59

Each of us must pay $ 28.92
