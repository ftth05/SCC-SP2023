 201 Scientific Computing in C++ Mon Wed 03/20/2023 - 04/19/2023 From 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM



 Summary of 201 Scientific Computing in C++
C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages, particularly in the STEM fields. Various C++ compilers are available for the majority of computer architectures and operating systems. This tutorial will provide skills to understand and write C++ code starting with the basics. There will be many hands-on time sessions to write code. You will learn how to write, compile and debug some C code comfortably. You will understand and use the basic con-structs of C++; manipulate C++ datatypes, such as arrays, strings, containers, and pointers; isolate and fix common errors in C++ programs; use memory appropriately, including proper allocation/deallocation procedures; apply object-oriented approaches to software problems in C++, making use of structs, classes and objects. Several C++ problems will be presented and solved. Some of the newest feature of C++ will also mentioned/looked at. 

Prerequisites: Participants are expected to have familiarity with the command line either on UNIX/LINUX or windows.
